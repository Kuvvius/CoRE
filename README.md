## 🧠 CoRE: Contrastive Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Experience

This repository contains the official code for the paper:

**[Toward Structured Knowledge Reasoning: Contrastive Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00842)**

> **CoRE** proposes a contrastive learning framework that enhances retrieval-augmented generation by aligning reasoning paths with structured experiences.

需要我帮你生成一个更详细的版本（例如添加安装环境、用法说明的模板）或等你代码准备好后再丰富这个文档？🙂
