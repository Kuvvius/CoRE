## CoRE: Contrastive Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Experience

This repository contains the official code for the paper:

**[Toward Structured Knowledge Reasoning: Contrastive Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00842)**

> **CoRE** proposes a contrastive learning framework that enhances retrieval-augmented generation by aligning reasoning paths with structured experiences.
